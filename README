Backing up my vim plugins because I will miss it dearly if I ever lose my laptop.
But if you are a Rails dev and have previously used Sublime Text2, my plugins 
might be very useful.

Also I believe it is a good entry plugins for new vim users. It even has 100+ colorschemes!


Notable Plugin list.

* CtrlP     :   Make file navigation a breeze. Similar to cmd+P in Sublime Text 2
* Ack       :   Allows search through directory. It is faster than GREP(needs proof on this).
* snipMate  :   Allows snippet auto completion. Allows super fast coding.
* surround  :   Efficiently puts surround html tag.
* tcomment  :   Commenting your code will be a breeZe
* nerdtree  :   Those little sidebars on the left.
* zencoding :   Enough said



Notable Map binding(based on Mac) (I used MacVim)

*  Ctrl + b :  run 'bundle install' on MacVim
*  CMD  + d :  :vsplit
*  CMD  + D :  :hsplit(horizontal split)
*  CMD  + j :  CTRL_W+w (navigate through split views)

*  CMD  + k :  NerdTree toggle
*  CMD  + t :  CtrlP


Miscellaneous 

* There are 100+ color schemes
* Javascript - wombat
* Ruby - twilight, railscast
